Therese: concern with putting backgrounds on views - whether it will overly draw kids' attention to putting pictures on views? Marlene: Share the concern. Trying to figure out the first step to get graphics in views. Any idea to make it seem like less important? Fernando: Move it down below scaffolds. (Something to be implemented) Marlene: missing the function for drawing backgrounds; graphic literacy lost when the function of dragging images into views was introduced Bodong: Generic KF view templates tied to knowledge-building analytics (inspired by Android app Themer) Community design Fernando and Freddy will work on a design for the Welcome page of KF Susana: think through the scenarios (esp. for new users) View links Use the same icon",

A few articles about detecting affect from log data reminded me that we need to be thoughtful on this issue so we don't lose the opportunity to tackle interesting research / practical questions in the future. We don't necessarily need to collect each 'keystroke', but I believe \"clickstream\" (clicks in the browser) would be necessary. Of course, how we organize these data in MySQL database is another question. This is Coursera's data export procedure for researchers. It may give us some insights.",

"text": "Just a few thoughts: Note - Hide the Edit button for notes I cannot edit - Move the Promising Ideas and Build-On buttons to the bottom - Display of read vs. unread. Just wondering whether we should consider \"inclusiveness\" of using colors. Should we also include Bold vs. Regular to help color-blind people recognize the difference. - When a note is opened, \"Read Contribution\" should not be displayed so big, while the note title is so small. It's the same for \"New contribution\" for creating a note. - Dragging: it will be great to figure out a way to not opening a note while dragging on its title. Rather than changing the open gesture to double-clicking, it will be helpful to keep single-clicking to open a note. View - Links: We will have multiple types of links later. So it will be great to keep link colors consistent. If we want to keep the function of customizing link color, limit the choices to a few good colors, rather than giving a whole pallete to users to choose from.",

It systematically reviews analytic tools that have been built for knowledge building and the state-of-the-art learning analytics techniques. It aims to conceptualize knowledge building analytics based on discussion of epistemology, assessment, pedagogy, and stakeholders. Informed by this discussion, it goes further to explore indicators that matter for knowledge building, and shifts to discuss design and application of knowledge building analytics. A demo of building analytic tools with the new Knowledge Forum APIs will be provided. Important issues around Data Bank and ethics will be further discussed. What? Where are we: A review of knowledge building analytics Standing on the shoulders of others: A review of learning analytics research Conceptual framework of knowledge building analytics: Epistemology, assessment, and many more Knowledge building indicators that matter Designing powerful knowledge building analytics Designing pedagogical interventions around knowledge building analytics Nurturing an ecosystem: Building analytic tools with Knowledge Forum APIs Knowledge Building Data Bank Ethics considerations and solutions Who? Invitation-based? Open call?",

"headline": "Open Badges",
"text": "We talked a little bit about Open Digital Badges at yesterday's lab meeting. I said it made a lot of sense to use Open Badges for professional development but not knowledge building analytics. But later on, I changed my mind. Now, My theory - is Open Badges could be quite powerful to be integrated in knowledge building analytics. - An example - they could be build into user profiles to provide extrinsic motivation for various knowledge building behaviors, although we need to be careful to ensure students do not build knowledge solely for badges. - Note that open badges come with not only a score, but evidence of achievement. Another interesting things will be designing the badges themselves. What analytics should we put in a knowledge building badge? Thinking of lifelong knowledge building and knowledge creating societies, what Open Badges could possibly offer is quite exciting. Important information - To learn more about it, check out this video by Daniel Hickey, a prof from Indiana University (first 5 mins will be enough to get a sense of it): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-U2gzwZUHA , as well as the Open Badges website from Mozzila http://www.openbadges.org/ - I personally do not know much about open badges. It will be great if someone could study it a bit more. I/we need to understand - whether/how could we issue badges? and we could make badges based on data from Knowledge Forum? -",
